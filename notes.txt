- make a search interface
- look up how to modify object constructors
- look up how to organize modules for imports
- add tests
- typescriptify??
- look into db... leaning towards mongo
- could eventually extend the genius-lyrics-api library with my own functions (could be worth a re-write in my own words?)
- look into adding docker to package mongodb with it??

----

I pretty much have 2 pathways for lyrics-fetcher. Either I'm given a genius url, or title and artist.

Genius URL:
- In this case I know exactly what I'm looking for. Try it to see if it errors.

Title and Artist:
- If more than one result, get the user to give feedback on the desired result to use.
- Would it work if it were a y/n or press up/down type of ui?

----

I think I might have to only accept URLs for lookups.
- Maybe just keep them separate? ie provide a list of URLs or provide a csv list of title/artist

----

use mongod to start db
open new tab, use mongo to open repl

Bring it back to basics. Just build a script that takes in a text file and a list of words and outputs whether or not the words appear.

If we want to get fancy, could make command line options to:
    - output with color
    - output more or less verbose
    - be more or less strict with words
